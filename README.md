## 🚀 Getting Started: Development Setup

Get up and running with the OverEngineered development environment in a few steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [**Node.js v20 LTS**](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    git clone https://github.com/anywaymachines/overengineered.git
    cd overengineered
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Rokit**
    [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) is required for asset and place management. Choose one of the methods below.

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Recommended (No Rust Required)</strong></summary>

    -   **Linux / macOS:**
        ```bash
        curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
        ```
    -   **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/main/scripts/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
        ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary><strong>Alternative (Requires Rust/Cargo)</strong></summary>

    -   First, install [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
    -   Then, install Rokit:
        ```bash
        cargo install rokit
        ```
    </details>

4.  **Assemble the Place File**
    Before opening Studio, you must generate the `place.rbxl` file:
    ```bash
    lune run assemble
    ```

5.  **Start the Development Server**
    This command launches all necessary services, including the TypeScript compiler and Rojo server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Connect Rojo in Roblox Studio**
    -   Open the generated `place.rbxl` file in Roblox Studio.
    -   Navigate to **Plugins → Rojo → Connect**.
    -   Your local code will now sync automatically with the Studio environment.

You're all set! Make changes in your code editor and watch them appear live in Studio.

> **Note:** When the development server is running, saving assets inside the place will automatically organize all models into their respective folders.
