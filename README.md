## üõ† Getting Started

Get up and running with OverEngineered's development environment in just a few steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anywaymachines/overengineered.git
   cd overengineered
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   It is recommended to use **Node.js v20 LTS** for best compatibility. Download it from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/).

   Ensure Node.js is installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Download Rokit**

   Download and install [rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) (required for asset and place management):

   ```bash
   # Download and follow instructions from https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit
   ```

4. **Assemble the Place File**

   Before starting Rojo or working in Roblox Studio, you must assemble the place file:

   ```bash
   lune run assemble
   ```

   This will generate or update `place.rbxl` using the current assets and structure.

5. **Run the Build Watcher**

   In a separate terminal, start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

   This compiles TypeScript/roblox-ts code into Roblox Lua in real-time.

6. **Start Rojo**

   Install [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) in Roblox Studio, then launch the server:

   ```bash
   rojo serve
   ```

7. **Open Roblox Studio and Connect Rojo**

   - Open Roblox Studio.
   - In Roblox Studio, open the generated `place.rbxl` file.
   - After the place is open, navigate to **Plugins ‚Üí Rojo ‚Üí Connect** to connect Rojo.
   - Your local code and assets will sync automatically with the Roblox environment.

8. **Start Building!**

   Make changes locally and watch them come to life in Roblox Studio.
