## 🛠 Getting Started

Get up and running with OverEngineered's development environment in just a few steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anywaymachines/overengineered.git
   cd overengineered
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Rojo**

   Install [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) in Roblox Studio, then launch the server:

   ```bash
   rojo serve
   ```

4. **Run the Build Watcher**

   In a separate terminal, start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

   This compiles TypeScript/roblox-ts code into Roblox Lua in real-time.

5. **Connect Roblox Studio**

   - Open Roblox Studio and navigate to **Plugins → Rojo → Connect**.
   - Your local code and assets will sync automatically with the Roblox environment.

6. **Start Building!**

   Make changes locally and watch them come to life in Roblox Studio.
